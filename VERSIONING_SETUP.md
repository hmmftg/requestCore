# Automatic Semantic Versioning Setup

This commit demonstrates the automatic semantic versioning system.

## Features Added:
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic versioning
- Version management script with conventional commit support
- Makefile integration for easy version management
- Git hooks for commit message validation
- Comprehensive documentation

This is a feature addition that should trigger a minor version bump.
