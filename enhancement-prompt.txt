make a new branch, enhance folder structure of library by golang best practices, the purpose of this library is to help build apps with basic configs and business specific params (some parameters might need to be stored encrypted) with jeager|splunk|stdout|none logger support  and rest-api handlers(maybe grpc handlers later) with strong base foundation that handles validation and tracing(with open-telemetry and slog) and error handling and panic recovery, don't rewrite the methods or make change in any logic, don't make name conflicts with standard library
